ng_login
========

In this app I'm trying to acheive two following goals:

    * Setup Ansible provisioning
    * An Angular App that consumes Rest services from a Django Rest Framework Powered Django App


This app is just for someone who wants to get hints for Ansible provisioning for an angular and django app. 
Certainly this is not for production use in any case.
